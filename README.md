# Finance Dashboard App with Machine Learning Predictions

This is a Read ME guide for my MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) Finance Dashboard App with Machine Learning Predictions. The application will utilize various technologies and libraries to provide a powerful and interactive finance dashboard experience.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following tools and frameworks installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) (included with Node.js installation)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (or any preferred code editor)
- [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) (optional, for automatic server restart)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (optional, for containerization)

## Frontend Technologies

The frontend of the Finance Dashboard App will be built using the following technologies:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) - A fast build tool for modern web applications.
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/v6.3.0/getting-started) - A popular routing library for React applications.
- [React Dropzone](https://github.com/react-dropzone/react-dropzone) - An easy-to-use drag and drop file uploader for React.
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started) - A comprehensive state management library for React applications.
- [Redux Toolkit Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview) - A powerful data fetching and caching library for Redux Toolkit.

- [Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/) - A charting library for React that provides a simple and declarative way to create interactive charts.

## Backend Technologies

The backend of the Finance Dashboard App will be built using the following technologies:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - A JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - A flexible and minimalistic web application framework for Node.js.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - A popular NoSQL database used for storing and retrieving data.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd finance-dashboard-app
```

3. Install the dependencies for the frontend and backend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install

cd ../backend
npm install
```

4. Set up the environment variables:

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and provide the necessary environment variables, such as the MongoDB connection string.

5. Start the development servers:

```bash
# Start the frontend server
cd frontend
npm run dev

# Start the backend server
cd ../backend
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`, and the backend API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.
